These are the basic elements of programming, as they allow us to perform calculations and make decisions based on the results.\nYou can use an expression  anywhere a value is expected, e.g. B. in a variable assignment, a function argument or a conditional statement.\nAll expressions in programming have specific syntax and evaluation rules  depending on the programming language  used.\n\n ",
